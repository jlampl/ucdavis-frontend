# UC Davis CRHD Data Visualization Web Project

This project was intended to visualize data uploaded by the UC Davis Center for Reducing Health Disparities (CRHD)
via spreadhseet.  This was a senior project created by the SB6 Devlopment Team.  I was a member of SB6.
The front end for this project was created using Angular 4.  

The Google Maps components and services
in the front end (in this repo) are essentially complete, but due to the lack of available data
the client was able to give to the team, the corresponding backend service to store
the geocoded address (as a lat/lng coordinate pair) and provide it to the front end
was never implemented.  The related components and services are in this repo
purely to showcase what is capable in this project.
